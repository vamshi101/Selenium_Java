Abstraction: hiding the implementation details and showing only functionalities to the user is called abstraction.
ex:-  it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details,
		sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
We can achieve abstraction in java through abstract classes and interfaces.

Abstract Class:- Abstract class has a key word abstract. An abstract class cam have both abstract and concrete methods.
	abstract method is nothing but a method without body. we can achieve 0-100% abstraction.
	all the abstract methods of abstract class must be implemented in its child class.
Abstract class cannot be instantiated. An abstract class can be extended by a class using keyword called Extends.
--------------------------------------------------==========--------------------------
Interfaces:- interface is a blue print of a class, keyword interface.
we can achieve 100% abstraction through interfaces,.
all the methods of an interface must be implemented in its implemented classes.
interfaces cannot be instantiated,
by default all the interfaces are public, static and final.
Interface is implemented by a class, by using keyword implements.
multiple inheritance through interfaces.
==============================================================================================
		   abstraction class:             					  			 interface:
	Abstract cls has a keyword abstract 					  interface has a keyword interface
	Abstract cls can have abstract-concrete methods    		  interface by default, all methods are abstract methods
	achieve 0-100% abstraction						   can achieve 100% abstraction
	multiple inheritance not possible using abstract 		   multiple inheritance possible using interfaces
	can have Static, non static, final, non final variables			by default all the variables are static and final. 
	Can have the data members/class membrs
	(public, private, protected, default access modifiers)	 by default all the data members are Public
	Can be extended by using keyword Extends.			Can be implemented by keyword Implements.
